# Ant Colony Optimization
Here I create an agent based model of an ant colony and solve simple path optimization problems with the use of pheromones.  This was the final project for Physics 113: Computation Physics.  
The colony is created through the interactions of ~100 ant objects (which have simple methods and parameters) and several overlapping grids representing the world of food, obstacles, and pheromones.  
Ants are able to find the shortest routes around obstacles with only local knowledge of the contents of the world directly adjacent to them, through use of pheromones and negative forcings on pheromones from the environment.
